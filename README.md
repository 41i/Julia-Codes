Parallel Linear Algebraic Routines for Julia

Abstract
---------
Julia is a high performance dynamic language, and it is imperative for any high performance framework
to address linear algebra. In this project, we implement various linear algebraic algorithms, thus making Julia self-sufficient language. 

Description
-------------
Following algorithms will be implemented.
Linear Solvers
LU Factorization
Cholskey Factorization
Iterative Grahm-Schmidt algorithm
Solver for Tridiagonal system using spike algorithm
Least Square solver
SVD
QR Factorization 
Once deployed, the second task is to benchmark the performance against Intel MKL, uBlas and matlab equivalents 

Timeline
------------
Week 1
    Browsing Julia codebase and designing empty template interface for algorithm
Week 2 -4
    Implementing linear solvers
Week 5
    Implementing Least Square Solver
Week 6
    Implementing QR factorization
Week 7
    Implementing SVD algorithm
Week 8-9 
    Benchmarking and Documenting the work done
 

About me
--------------
I’m Pulkit Singhal, pursuing masters in Computer Science at IIIT Hyderabad. I’ve been involved with Lab of Spatial Informatics. I’m well versed with     Linear Algebra literature, and I have been using matlab for quite a time. I wish to contribute to Julia, because it gives me exposure to think about designing a complete library. Furthermore, I’m enthusiastic about learning algorithms like least square solver and QR factorization which I’ve seldom used.   

I will be completely dedicated for this project, contributing around 45 hours per week. I plan to stay at college for complete summers, so there are no holidays in between. Unfortunately, I cannot shift to Cambridge, nor I will be able to attend JuliaCon as I don’t have passport.
